                    <p className="subtext">Technology as we know today is powered by open source software and pieces of code developed by developers like you. However the profits and gains made by these softwares havenâ€™t translated into proportionate rewards to the engineers and developers who actually contributed to it. We are on a mission to change this.
                    <br/>Capita is a platform for tokenizing collaborative software projects, including open source, commercial, and hybrid Projects. Capita is built to integrate with Github and, in some respects, is a corollary technology: Github enables the management of inputs to a Project, while Capita enables the management of outputs from such Project.</p>
